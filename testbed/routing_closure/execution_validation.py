"""Execution validation — run the design phases against the criteria `routing_closure` declared.

The change answers one question for every phase that observes the composition: what happens when an
observation reports that nothing was found. The business answered it: the phase rejects, and judges
nothing. And every way the observing capability can answer is answered, now and when it gains one.

Criteria 1 and 2 dispatch a real phase workflow through `protocol_runtime`. Each makes one
observation answer NOT_FOUND at the capability boundary, by standing in for `inspector.api.query`
for that operation only, then reads the trace: the phase must end at EXIT_REJECTED, and the step
that judges must never run. A control run of the same document, with nothing replaced, must reach
the judging step.

Criterion 3 reads the assembled snapshot. Criterion 4 runs the generator over the artifacts as
text, with one invented outcome added to what the capability declares, and writes nothing.

Run:  python testbed/routing_closure/execution_validation.py [snapshot]
Exit: 0 if every exercised criterion holds, 1 otherwise.
