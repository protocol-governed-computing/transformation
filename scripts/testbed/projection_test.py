"""The P1 projection — reproducible, general, and refusing an inadmissible prior.

A projection is only worth trusting if it is the same document every time it runs. The dossier on
disk is therefore an assertion: re-project the seed, and what comes out must be byte-identical to
what is committed. A projection nobody re-runs drifts from its input exactly the way a hand-authored
fixture drifts from its dossier.

Generality comes from CR-1, a different CR of a different type with registers of different sizes.
Its P1 was authored by hand before the projection existed: every register row already matched what
the compiler derives, and only the preamble and a widened vocabulary heading differed. That is the
strongest evidence the projection is right, and asserting it byte for byte is what stops the
authored and derived forms diverging again.

Run:  python scripts/testbed/projection_test.py
Exit: 0 if every case matched, 1 otherwise.
