"""Which upstream documents a phase document is judged against — derived, never restated.

Two harnesses need this answer and neither should hold its own copy of it. The differential judges
corpus documents against their priors; the payload builder embeds those priors into the runtime
payloads. A hand-kept table in either one is a table that goes stale the first time a probe is added,
which is what happened before this module existed.

Two facts already exist and this reads them rather than duplicating them:

  **which phases** a document is judged against — `PRIORS` in that phase's rule module, which is also
  what the compiled workflow declares;

  **which dossier** supplies them — the document's own `**CR:**` header, which every dossier document
  carries because P1 is the Change Request phase whatever domain it runs against.

So a new probe needs no wiring at all: cut it from a fixture, and it is judged against that fixture's
priors because it says so in its own header.
