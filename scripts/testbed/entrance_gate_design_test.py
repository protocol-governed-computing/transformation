"""An entrance supplies what its gate requires — B25.

A design changed an entrance to stop sending a field its workflow no longer read, and reused the
workflow's gate, which still required it. Every request through the entrance was refused at
admission, with every phase admitting the design and construction at 100%. Shown here: the rule
fires on that shape; stays silent once the design redeclares the gate without the field; stays
silent while the entrance still supplies it; and reads the gate from the design's topology when the
design states one.

Run:  python scripts/testbed/entrance_gate_design_test.py
