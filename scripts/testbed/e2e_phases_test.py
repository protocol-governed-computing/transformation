"""End-to-end phase check — every phase through the real runtime.

The differential (`differential.py`) drives the capability transforms directly. It proves the rule
sets and the check logic, and it proves nothing about IN/WF/CC wiring, node input bindings, or
routing — because it never boots a snapshot or dispatches a workflow.

That gap is not theoretical. A workflow that bound `$.capability_result.header` across nodes passed
the differential and failed the moment it ran through `protocol_runtime`: workflow nodes read the
intent payload, not a previous node's result. Only executing the compiled workflow catches that
class of defect.

So this script executes each phase the way the runbook used to, one case per line, and asserts the
expected verdict and finding count. Adding a phase is an entry in `CASES` — the runbook stays one
line however many phases exist.

Run:  python scripts/testbed/e2e_phases.py [snapshot_root]
Exit: 0 if every case matched, 1 otherwise.
