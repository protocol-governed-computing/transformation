"""Meta-validation suite — the rule sets themselves, before any suite judges a document.

Every other suite in this directory asserts a verdict over a document. A verdict is only evidence
if the rules that produced it could all run: a rule naming a check kind that no longer exists, or
omitting a parameter that check requires on every path, does not fail loudly at the top of a run —
it fails, or silently contributes nothing, at whatever moment a document happens to reach it. A
suite that never authored such a document passes while proving less than it reports.

So this runs first and it is a gate, not a report. `assert_consistent()` is called at the head of
each suite that evaluates rule sets, which is why this file is importable as well as runnable.

Run:  python scripts/testbed/meta_test.py
Exit: 0 if the declaration/enforcement correspondence holds, 1 otherwise.
