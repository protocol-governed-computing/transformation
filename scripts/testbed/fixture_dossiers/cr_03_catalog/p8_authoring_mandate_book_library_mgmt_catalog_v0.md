## Gate 2 — Mandate Approval

**Gate 2 closes here**, and it freezes scope before authoring begins. After it, any departure is an
Approved Deviation recorded in the authoring manifest — never a silent change.

**Status: CLOSED.** Approved by the business author against the composition `9c2c693d882e…`, the one
`baseline.json` pins, after Construction Completeness read 100% on all six acts.

What is frozen is six acts and what each announces. The acts are re-rendered whole from the design,
which is what an EXTEND means, so nothing about them is edited in place and the announcements arrive
with the rendering. **A moment announced by editing a built artifact is outside this mandate** — and
so is a moment the business never declared, which is why neither reinstatement act is here.
