"""Keyed nodes — one contract run at several places in one workflow.

A workflow that refuses for several reasons and records each refusal runs one recording contract at
several places, each handed its own reason. A node named by its contract's code can be only one of
those places, so the topology names each place with a key and states the contract it runs in `Runs`.
Shown here: construction renders each key as a node running the contract, with its own inputs; a
design that keys its nodes passes every rule that reads the topology, including a discharge that
names a keyed step; and each rule that governs keys fires on a design built to trip it and stays
silent on the one that keeps it. A design with no `Runs` column is the design language as it was.

Run:  python scripts/testbed/keyed_node_design_test.py
