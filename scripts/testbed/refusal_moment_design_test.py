"""Refusal moments — an act that refuses may announce the refusal, and nothing else.

A moment names something that happened, so it is announced from an ending that completes the act. A
refusal is itself something that happened: a business that records every refused request may need
to announce the refusal from the ending that refuses. Shown here: a refusing ending announcing a
moment the design declares a refusal is admissible; the same ending announcing an undeclared moment,
or a declared one alongside an undeclared one, is refused; and a completing ending is unaffected.
