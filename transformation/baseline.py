"""The pinned baseline.

Validation runs against a named, frozen snapshot — never "the current snapshot". Every register a
snapshot-reading phase emits encodes facts about one specific composition: which artifacts exist,
what the normative closure contains, what a REUSE decision found. Against a moving snapshot those
fixtures fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the transformation compiler, and a
regression becomes indistinguishable from a rebuild.

So: a run that observes a different snapshot_id fails before any phase executes. Rebaselining is a
deliberate, reviewed act — re-pin the id, re-approve the affected registers.

**Re-approval is the half the pin could not previously record.** Verifying the id proves the
composition is the one named; it proves nothing about whether anyone re-read the registers that
encode facts about it. A register asserting `impacted_count 58` goes false without anyone editing
it, and after a re-pin there was no way to tell "re-grounded against this snapshot" from "never
re-checked since the id changed". `approved_registers` records the second half, and because it
lives in the file the id lives in, re-pinning drops it: an approval is against one composition and
survives no other.

**Which registers need approving is derived, not declared.** A register rests on a snapshot fact
exactly when a rule governing it consults an observation, which the rule set already says. A
hand-kept list would be a second declaration that drifts from the rules the moment either changes.
