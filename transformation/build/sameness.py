"""
Whether an amendment keeps an artifact's meaning, by the rules the platform declares.

A change of meaning is a new identity (`4c` ID-5, `4e` SU-11); a change of how a declaration is
written keeps the one it has. Construction compared an amendment with what it amends only for the
facts it would lose, so an amendment that added or altered a fact was built under the old identity,
and every change of the last cycle was. This compares the whole declaration.

What carries no meaning is not decided here. The platform declares it in
`artifact::VOCAB_DECLARATION_REPRESENTATION_V1`: the parts that only explain, the lists read as
sets, the parts that name another artifact, and the rules a comparison applies. This module applies
exactly those rules, and refuses to compare when the declaration names one it does not apply — a
comparison that skipped a declared rule would call a change of wording a change of meaning, or the
reverse, without saying so.
