"""Construction Completeness — the Construction lifecycle's admission gate.

A phase document is admitted by `tc phase check` against a declared rule set. A *design* is admitted
to construction by this: does it uniquely determine the artifacts it specifies? `UNIQUELY_DETERMINED_
OR_STOP` is the rule, and a percentage below the threshold is a refusal, not a report.

    CR-1 as first authored     54.8%
    construction requirement   100%, or the generator is inventing design

**The requirement list is derived, never declared.** It is the shape `render_all` emits, walked leaf
by leaf, so it cannot drift from construction — it *is* construction. An earlier version kept a
hand-written list and read 100% while the generator could reproduce one artifact in twenty-five: it
asked whether a contract declared a pipeline and never whether each step declared its store. A
hand-maintained list of what construction needs is a second opinion about construction, and the
weaker one. The declared list held 170 facts; the derived one holds 710.

**This needs nothing to have been built.** That is what separates it from the acceptance harness,
which compares a render against artifacts that already exist and can therefore only ever judge CR-1.
This judges a design on its own, which is what every CR after the first needs before a line of it is
authored.
