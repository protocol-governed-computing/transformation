"""Construction — render protocol artifacts from a design and a mandate.

The Construction lifecycle sits between Transformation and Compilation. P0–P8 judge documents and
emit verdicts; construction consumes `DesignIntent(P7) + AuthoringMandate(P8)` and emits artifacts.
It is the first governed step that *creates* rather than judges, which is why it is a lifecycle
stage and not a tenth phase — numbering it would blur a construction failure ("the mandate was valid
but did not uniquely determine an artifact") back into a P8 failure ("the mandate is incomplete").

**What is rendered is the Machine block.** An artifact's prose is human narrative — intent,
rationale, the reasoning a reviewer needs — and no register determines it or should. The Machine
block is what the compiler reads, what the snapshot seals and what the runtime executes, so it is
what a design has to determine. Acceptance is semantic equality of that block, never text equality
of the file.

Nothing here decides anything. Every value is read from a register or from a constitution-fixed
default, and a fact the design does not state is a fact this module must not invent — an inventing
generator is a second, ungoverned design authority. Where a value cannot be derived, the renderer
omits it and the acceptance harness reports it as undetermined.

**Some artifacts are not written here at all.** An artifact the design declares in
`generation_provenance` is reached by invoking its generator, and this module renders none of it:
rendering it would make construction a second producer of an artifact something else already
produces, and two producers of one truth drift silently until something reads the stale one. The
artifact is still scheduled and still measured — what the design owes for it is the generator.

# The domain build manifest ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Not an artifact any change request designs. Every field of it is compiler configuration — which
# layers to search, how a namespace is matched, where projections are written — and a design that
# restated them would be declaring something it does not own, exactly as it would by restating a
# constitution.
#
# Hand-copying it per domain had failed visibly: the book library's manifest described itself as the
# AI governance domain and listed that domain's subdomains, because it was copied and never
# corrected, and nothing governed it. So it is derived from the three facts that actually vary — the
# domain, its subdomains, and the families it uses — all of which the mandate already declares.
#
# **It is a generated artifact, and a design that touches it says so** rather than restating it. The
# cost of the other reading was measured: a change adding a subdomain inventoried this as an EXTEND,
# and because an amendment must state the artifact whole it was obliged to restate fifty-one derived
# facts and invented a fifty-second — a `core.subdomain` the artifact does not carry — while the
# only thing that actually varies with a subdomain is one sentence of the summary. Reached now by
# invoking `build_manifest` through `build.generators`, which is also what the acceptance harness
# compares, so the claim that this derives what the composition holds is checked rather than
# asserted.

# it down and a reader can follow the successor.

# construction's to rewrite here; the prose is human narrative no register determines. So this is a
# header amendment and nothing else, and it is idempotent — running it twice leaves one marking.
#
# **What this does not do.** The compiler still discovers and compiles a marked artifact, because
# nothing in the governance surface models supersession. The marking is the record, and excluding a
# superseded artifact from a composition is a platform question that belongs with the platform.
