CT_PURE_EVALUATE_RULES_V0

Pure Capability Transform (Atom)

Purpose:
    Apply a declared rule set to parsed registers and report every rule that failed.

Implementation:
    - Iterates the supplied rule set, dispatching each rule to its check kind
    - Every rule is applied to every document; no short-circuit on first failure, because a
      rule that stops running is a rule that cannot be trusted
    - An unknown check kind raises: a silently skipped rule reports green over an unevaluated
      subject, which is the failure this transform exists to prevent
    - Carries no policy: what is checked and why is declared in the rule set, not here
    - No side effects, no external state
