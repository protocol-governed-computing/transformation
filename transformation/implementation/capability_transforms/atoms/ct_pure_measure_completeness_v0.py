CT_PURE_MEASURE_COMPLETENESS_V0

Pure Capability Transform (Atom)

Purpose:
    Measure whether a design uniquely determines the artifacts it specifies, and refuse when it
    does not.

Implementation:
    - Derives the requirement list from what the renderer emits, so it cannot drift from
      construction
    - Raises when completeness is below the declared threshold: UNIQUELY_DETERMINED_OR_STOP is a
      refusal, not a report, and the runtime maps a raise to VIOLATION
    - No side effects, no external state

Purity Class: ct_pure
