CT_PURE_RENDER_ARTIFACTS_V0

Pure Capability Transform (Atom)

Purpose:
    Render every protocol artifact a mandate schedules, from the design that determines it.

Implementation:
    - Renders the whole mandate in one call: a capability contract is a fixed pipeline with no
      iteration, so a step that rendered one artifact could never render twenty-five
    - Emits the Machine block, which is what the compiler reads, the snapshot seals and the runtime
      executes; an artifact's prose is human narrative no register determines
    - Invents nothing. Every value comes from a register or a constitution-fixed default, and the
      completeness gate ahead of this step is what guarantees there is nothing left to invent
    - No side effects, no external state
