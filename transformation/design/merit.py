"""Figure of merit — a deterministic rating of a phase document.

Ported from RI-0's `engine/dossier.py:rate_stage`. The shape is kept: begin at the maximum,
subtract for named defects, clamp, and report the reasons alongside the number.

**This module holds no policy.** What is deducted and by how much is declared in
`transformation::STRUCTURE_FIGURE_OF_MERIT_POLICY_V1` and read from the composition. That split is
the same one the phases themselves obey — a rule set is governance and lives in the snapshot, a
check kind is a mechanism and may live in code. Weights in Python would make the quality bar a
property of a build tool: unversioned, unreadable from the composition, changeable without a
governed act.

**The rating is not the verdict.** Admissibility is decided by the rule set alone. The two axes are
independent in both directions: an admissible document can rate poorly for carrying declared open
questions, and an inadmissible one can rate well when a single misspelled citation is fatal to
admissibility but cheap in quality.

Without a composition there is no policy, and therefore no rating — reported as *not computed*,
never as a default. A figure of merit invented from a built-in fallback would look exactly like one
read from governance, which is the failure the phases' own grounding rules avoid by refusing to
pass quietly when they could not check.
