"""The generator behind every phase workflow — its sealed rule set, and the provenance saying so.

A phase declares its rules once, in `transformation/design/pN_*/rules.py`, over the registers its
template declares. The compiled workflow carries a *copy* of that declaration, because the rules
travel in the artifact where they can be sealed, versioned and inspected. Two copies of one truth
drift, and this one drifted silently: adding a rule after emitting a workflow left 52 rules sealed
against 55 declared, and every run reported confidently on the smaller set.

So the copy is generated, never typed, and this module is the generator. **A template and the
declaration read with it are one generator** — neither determines the artifact alone, and naming
either separately would permit regenerating from a stale pairing.

Two things are emitted into each workflow, and they answer different questions. The `rule_set:`
block is what the phase judges by. The `## Generated Artifact` section is what the artifact says
about itself: that it is generated, by what, and from which sources. Provenance belongs to the
artifact rather than to a list beside it, because a second statement of one truth can disagree with
the thing it describes.

**The generator is authoritative.** Where a workflow and this module disagree, the workflow is
stale — a disagreement is not a difference of opinion. Correcting the artifact would leave the
generator still producing the old value, so the fix would last until whoever next ran the emission.
`check()` is what makes that enforceable rather than merely stated.

This lives inside the package rather than under `scripts/` because construction must be able to
*invoke* it: a generated artifact is reached by invoking its generator, and a generator only a
person at a terminal can run is one nothing governs. `scripts/emit_rule_sets.py` remains as the
terminal's way in.
