# WF_P6_GOVERNANCE_INTENT_ADMISSIBILITY_V0

## Header (Mandatory)

- **Artifact Code:** WF_P6_GOVERNANCE_INTENT_ADMISSIBILITY_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** workflow
- **Governed By:** CONSTITUTION_WORKFLOW_V0
- **Version:** V0
- **Status:** draft
- **Supersedes:** NONE

---

## Generated Artifact

This artifact is generated. The rule set in its `Machine` block is a **sealed copy**, and
the copy is never corrected directly: where this artifact and its generator disagree, this
artifact is stale, and an edit here lasts until whoever next runs the emission.

- **Generator:** `transformation.design.emit:emit_rule_sets`
- **Generator sources** — one generator together, never separately:
  - `templates/p6_governance_intent_template_v0.md`
  - `transformation/design/p6_governance_intent/rules.py`

To change what this phase judges, amend a source and invoke the generator.
`tc phase emit --check` refuses a build in which the two disagree.

---

## 1. Intent

Phase 6 of the change pipeline: decide whether an offered Governance Intent register is admissible.

P6 answers WHERE — which subdomain owns each capability, which owns each store, and what crosses a
boundary. It is the phase that draws lines.

---

## 2. The ladder does not simply accumulate

Stage 5 requires provisional artifact codes; this stage forbids them. That looks like a step
backwards and is not: each rung admits its *own* vocabulary rather than everything below it. P6's
vocabulary is placement, so a capability here is named in business language and placed in a
subdomain. A row naming a provisional code has answered a question this stage is not asking and
pre-empted one Stage 7 owns.

Existing artifacts stay citable by exact FQDN at every rung, because citing what already exists is
observation rather than design — which is why this workflow grounds.

## 3. What ownership exclusivity means here

A store is written only by capabilities of the subdomain that owns it. When a change needs a peer's
store written, the writing capability belongs to that peer and is declared as a dependency gap.
That is not visible in any single cell, so what is checked is the discipline that makes it
visible: a dependency states its direction, a satisfied one names the artifact that satisfies it,
and every capability in the outcome was placed in the ownership register first.
