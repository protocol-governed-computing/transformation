# WF_P2_DOMAIN_MODEL_ADMISSIBILITY_V0

## Header (Mandatory)

- **Artifact Code:** WF_P2_DOMAIN_MODEL_ADMISSIBILITY_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** workflow
- **Governed By:** CONSTITUTION_WORKFLOW_V0
- **Version:** V0
- **Status:** draft
- **Supersedes:** NONE

---

## Generated Artifact

This artifact is generated. The rule set in its `Machine` block is a **sealed copy**, and
the copy is never corrected directly: where this artifact and its generator disagree, this
artifact is stale, and an edit here lasts until whoever next runs the emission.

- **Generator:** `transformation.design.emit:emit_rule_sets`
- **Generator sources** — one generator together, never separately:
  - `templates/p2_domain_model_template_v0.md`
  - `transformation/design/p2_domain_model/rules.py`

To change what this phase judges, amend a source and invoke the generator.
`tc phase emit --check` refuses a build in which the two disagree.

---

## 1. Intent

Phase 2 of the change pipeline: decide whether an offered Domain Model register is admissible.

P2 is the first phase that **looks**. P0 and P1 judge a document against itself — structure,
vocabulary, traceability — and can reach a verdict without knowing anything about the system. P2
cannot: a register claiming an artifact already exists is making a claim about the assembled
composition, and only observation settles it.

So this workflow composes `CC_JUDGE_AGAINST_SNAPSHOT_V0` rather than `CC_JUDGE_DOCUMENT_V0`. The
difference is one governed observation step, bound to the snapshot this workflow executes from.

---

## 2. The first handoff this pipeline checks

P2 is also the first phase judged against the document it was handed. P1 declares what the author
believes the system already provides; P2's spine resolves each of those beliefs, and until now
nothing established that the two registers were about the same beliefs.

A dropped belief is invisible from either side. P1 never sees P2. P2's register is well formed with
two rows or with three. The defect exists only in the gap, so the rule needs both documents — which
is why this workflow takes `prior_texts` alongside the register it judges.

---

## 3. Grounding, and what it deliberately does not flag

Cited identities are classified against the observed composition by the identity-preserving
taxonomy: exact, typo-alias, wrong-domain, proposed-new, fabrication. Only a misspelling or a
wrong namespace is reported.

An identity absent from the baseline is **not** a finding. Every change request that designs
anything proposes identities that do not exist yet, and proposed-new cannot be told from fabricated
without the CR's declared new artifacts — which arrive at P7. Counting what was not found would
reject every correct dossier for doing its job.
