# AC_GATE_REVIEWER_V0

## 1. Intent

The person who confirms at a gate that a seed says what they meant.

An admissible verdict is a structural result: it establishes that the seed is well formed, never
that it is correct. Only a person can accept that, so the gate has a declared human actor and the
acceptance is recorded against them.
