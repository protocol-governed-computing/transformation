# AC_REGISTER_AUTHOR_V0

## 1. Intent

The person accountable for a phase register's content, from P1 onward.

`AC_SEED_AUTHOR_V0` is P0's actor and is named for the seed specifically. A register is a different
document with a different obligation — the seed author states business content, a register author
restates it under traceability — so the accountability is declared separately rather than stretched
to cover both.

The naming asymmetry is worth noting: had P0's actor been named for *phase authorship* rather than
for the seed, one artifact would have served both. Renaming it now would mean a new version of a
sealed artifact, which is not worth it for a name; the two actors coexist and the lesson applies to
later phases, which reuse this one.
