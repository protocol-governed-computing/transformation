# AC_SEED_AUTHOR_V0

## 1. Intent

The person accountable for a seed's content.

A seed is a faithful rewrite of a business problem statement, and someone must answer for whether it
says what the business meant. Declaring that as an actor makes authorship a property of the
composition rather than a convention: the pipeline cannot run without one, and no automated drafter
can occupy this role.
