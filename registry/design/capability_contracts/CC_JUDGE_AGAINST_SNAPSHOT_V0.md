# CC_JUDGE_AGAINST_SNAPSHOT_V0

## 1. Intent

Judge a phase document against a declared rule set, **against the composition it describes**, and
against the upstream phase documents it was handed.

Reused by every phase that grounds claims. Each supplies its own document and rule set; the
mechanism is the same one.

---

## 2. Why this is a separate contract

`CC_JUDGE_DOCUMENT_V0` judges a document alone and binds nothing. That is sufficient while a rule
is a property of what the register says about itself — structure, vocabulary, traceability.

It stops being sufficient the moment a register claims something already exists. That is a claim
about the assembled composition, and no amount of reading the document can settle it. Grounding
needs an observation, an observation is a side effect, and a contract that binds a side effect is a
different contract from one that binds none.

Both remain: a phase that grounds nothing should not acquire a capability it does not use, and a
contract that always observed would make every phase depend on a snapshot being present.

---

## 3. Why the prior parse does not fork the contract

Reading an upstream document is the other thing a rule may need from outside the document, and it
does **not** get its own contract. What forks a contract here is a side effect: an observation binds
a capability, and binding one is a commitment a phase that never observes should not make.

Parsing text the caller already supplied binds nothing and observes nothing. It is the same class of
step as parsing the judged document, which every contract already carries. Forking on it would give
three contracts six shapes and say nothing true about any of them.

So the step is unconditional, and a phase that reads no upstream document says so at the call site
by handing over an empty mapping. That is more inspectable than an absence: `prior_texts: {}` in a
compiled workflow is a declaration that this phase's handoff is ungoverned, and it is greppable.

## 4. Pipeline

| Step | Capability | Type | Operation |
|------|------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | CT_PURE_PARSE_REGISTERS_V0 | CT | Parse |
| 2 | CT_PURE_PARSE_PRIOR_PHASES_V0 | CT | Parse priors |
| 3 | CS_SNAPSHOT_QUERY_V0 | CS | QUERY (si.artifact.list) |
| 4 | CS_SNAPSHOT_QUERY_V0 | CS | QUERY (si.capability.surface) |
| 5 | CT_PURE_EVALUATE_RULES_V0 | CT | Evaluate |

## 5. Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| document_text | string | true | Full text of the phase document |
| prior_texts | object | true | Phase id → text of the upstream document; empty when none is read |
| rule_set | array | true | The declared rules deciding admissibility |

---

## 6. Outputs

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| verdict | string | ADMISSIBLE or INADMISSIBLE |
| findings | array | One entry per failed rule |
| rules_evaluated | integer | Number of rules applied |

---

## 7. Result Status Contract

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| SUCCESS | The composition was observed, the rule set applied in full, and a verdict reached |
| VIOLATION | The input was unusable, or a rule named an unimplemented check kind |
| BACKEND_ERROR | The bound snapshot could not be read |
