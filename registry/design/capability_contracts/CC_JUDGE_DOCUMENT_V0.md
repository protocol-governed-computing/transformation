## 1. Intent

Judge a phase document against a declared rule set: read it into registers, then apply every rule
and report what failed.

Reused by every phase. Each phase supplies its own document and its own rule set; the mechanism is
the same one.

---

## 2. Rationale

Parsing and evaluating are two steps of one governed capability rather than two capabilities. A
workflow composes capability *calls*, and data does not flow between them — a node reads the intent
payload, not a previous node's result. Chaining belongs inside a contract's pipeline, where step two
reads step one through `$.results.parse_registers.*`.

Keeping the two transforms separate still matters: parsing judges nothing and evaluating knows
nothing about markdown, so each can be reused or replaced without disturbing the other.

Admissibility must be reproducible — the same document and the same rule set always give the same
verdict. The rule set arrives as an input rather than as embedded content, so what is governed can
be read from the composition without reading any code.

## 3. Pipeline

| Step | Capability | Type | Operation |
|------|------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | CT_PURE_PARSE_REGISTERS_V0 | CT | Parse |
| 2 | CT_PURE_EVALUATE_RULES_V0 | CT | Evaluate |

---

## 4. Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| document_text | string | true | Full text of the phase document |
| rule_set | array | true | The declared rules deciding admissibility |

---

## 5. Outputs

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| verdict | string | ADMISSIBLE or INADMISSIBLE |
| findings | array | One entry per failed rule |
| rules_evaluated | integer | Number of rules applied |

---

## 6. Result Status Contract

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| SUCCESS | The rule set was applied in full and a verdict reached |
| VIOLATION | The input was unusable, or a rule named an unimplemented check kind |

  # Every step's outputs mapping accumulates into the CC surface, so declaring them here would

  # raw result directly instead, which the dispatcher addresses as
  # $.results.<step_id>.capability_result.<field>.
