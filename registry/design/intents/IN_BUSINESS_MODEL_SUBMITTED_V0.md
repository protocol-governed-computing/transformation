## 1. Intent

A Business Model register is offered to P4 for judgement.

The register arrives as text, as at every phase. What it will be judged *against* — the assembled
composition — is not supplied here: it is bound by the runtime binding to the snapshot the workflow
executes from. A caller can offer a document; it cannot choose the reality the document is checked
against.

        Phase id → full text of the upstream document — p3 carries the authoring decisions this
        model consolidates. Supplied by the driver alongside the register itself: a handoff is
        checked by reading both documents, and an absent prior is reported as an unchecked handoff
        rather than passed over.
    author_of_record:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: Identity of the person accountable for the register's content

  outcomes:
    ACK:
      description: Register accepted for judgement
    NACK:
      description: Register not accepted for judgement
