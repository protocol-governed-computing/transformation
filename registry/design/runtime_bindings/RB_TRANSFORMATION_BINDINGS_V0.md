# RB_TRANSFORMATION_BINDINGS_V0

## 1. Intent

Runtime bindings for the transformation phase pipeline.

Phases that judge a document alone bind nothing: they read text supplied to them and return a
verdict, persisting nothing.

From P2 onward a phase must *observe* the composition to ground what a register claims, and that is
a side effect — the same query answers differently against different compositions. It is bound here
to `{{snapshot_root}}`: **the snapshot the workflow is executing from**, not one a caller names. A
workflow that could be pointed at a different composition would report confidently about the wrong
one, and its evidence would be worthless.

Nothing here is writable. The observation capability is read-only by construction, so a phase
cannot alter the composition it is reasoning about.

extensions:
  notes:
    - This artifact performs no discovery and no inference.
    - The observed snapshot is the one the workflow runs inside, never one supplied by a caller.
    - No binding here can write; observation cannot disturb what it observes.
