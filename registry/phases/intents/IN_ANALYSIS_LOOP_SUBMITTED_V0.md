## 1. Intent

An Analysis Loop register is offered to P3 for judgement.

The register arrives as text, as at every phase. What it will be judged *against* — the assembled
composition — is not supplied here: it is bound by the runtime binding to the snapshot the workflow
executes from. A caller can offer a document; it cannot choose the reality the document is checked
against.

        Phase id → full text of the upstream document — p2 carries the domain model whose belief results this register re-verifies. Supplied by the
        driver alongside the register itself: a handoff is checked by reading both documents, and
        an absent prior is reported as an unchecked handoff rather than passed over.

      required: true
      description: Identity of the person accountable for the register's content

  outcomes:
    ACK:
      description: Register accepted for judgement
    NACK:
      description: Register not accepted for judgement
