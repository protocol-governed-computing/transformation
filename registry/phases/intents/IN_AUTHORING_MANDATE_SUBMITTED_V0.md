## 1. Intent

An Authoring Mandate is offered to P8 for judgement.

The register arrives as text, as at every phase. What it will be judged *against* — the assembled
composition — is not supplied here: it is bound by the runtime binding to the snapshot the workflow
executes from. A caller can offer a document; it cannot choose the reality the document is checked
against.

        Phase id → full text of the upstream document — p7 carries the design whose assigned
        identities this mandate schedules. Supplied by the driver alongside the mandate itself: a
        mandate is a derivation of a design, and it can only be checked against the design.
