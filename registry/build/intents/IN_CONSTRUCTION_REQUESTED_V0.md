## 1. Intent

Offer an approved design and mandate for construction.

Gate 1 approved the design and Gate 2 froze the mandate; this is the request to build from them.
Both documents travel in the payload rather than being read from a path, for the same reason a
phase document does: a governed capability reads what it is handed, and a capability that opened a
file would make its result depend on a filesystem the composition cannot see.
