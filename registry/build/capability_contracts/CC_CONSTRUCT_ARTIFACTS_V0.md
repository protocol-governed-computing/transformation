# CC_CONSTRUCT_ARTIFACTS_V0

## 1. Intent

Construct protocol artifacts from an approved design and mandate.

---

## 2. The gate is a step, not a convention

The pipeline measures before it renders, and the measurement **refuses**. A design below the
threshold never reaches the renderer, so "construction only runs on a design that determines its
output" is enforced by the composition rather than by a rule someone remembers.

This is why measuring and rendering are separate steps over the same derivation. One transform doing
both would have to choose between reporting a score and refusing.

**The refusal cannot carry its own name, and that is the CT status limit.** A transform has exactly
two outcomes — SUCCESS on return, VIOLATION on raise — so an under-determined design and a broken
construction reach the caller as the same status. An earlier draft of this contract declared
`UNDER_DETERMINED` in its surface and routed on it; nothing could ever produce it, which made it
dead routing and the vocabulary that declared it vacuous. That is the same defect this pipeline
found in `CC_REGISTER_PHYSICAL_COPY_V0`, reproduced immediately in the artifact written to govern
the finding. The refusal is distinguishable in the raised message, not in the status.

---

## 3. Both documents, parsed the same way

A design and a mandate are parsed by the same transform the phases use. Construction reading
documents through its own parser would let it disagree with the oracle that admitted them about what
a register contains.

| Step | Capability | Type | Operation |
|------|------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | CT_PURE_PARSE_REGISTERS_V0 | CT | Parse the design |
| 2 | CT_PURE_PARSE_REGISTERS_V0 | CT | Parse the mandate |
| 3 | CT_PURE_MEASURE_COMPLETENESS_V0 | CT | Gate |
| 4 | CT_PURE_RENDER_ARTIFACTS_V0 | CT | Render |

  # Rendering now precedes the gate, and the gate is unchanged in what it protects. The measure tests

  # the renderer runs, reports one source per leaf, and the gate reads the origins derived from them.

  # Nothing is written before the gate. Rendering is pure and produces a shape in memory; persistence
  # is a separate contract and still runs only on a design the gate admitted. What the gate stops is
  # a construction being *written* from a design that does not determine it, and it still does.
