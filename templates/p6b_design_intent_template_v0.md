# Design Intent: [domain] / [subdomain]
**Domain:** [domain]  
**Subdomain:** [subdomain]  
**Version:** V0  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Pipeline Stage:** Stage 6b — Design Intent (HOW)  
**Produced by:** v0.5.0 SDLC authoring pipeline  
**Purity:** HOW only — business facts (Business Model) and placement decisions (Governance Intent) not repeated  

---

## Document Contract

**This artifact is a structured register document — not a narrative.** 6b assigns the **binding
FQDNs** the rest of the build depends on. The worker emits register ROWS; a deterministic renderer
owns the document and a structural oracle validates the codes BEFORE a human reviews.

VALID OUTPUT:
- Populated register tables (every required register below)
- Binding FQDNs in `code` / `rb_code` / `binds_wf` / `storage_structure` columns, each
  well-formed (`domain::PREFIX_NAME_V<n>`) and assigned EXACTLY ONCE
- Business-language capability descriptions in the `capability` column

INVALID OUTPUT:
- Narrative summaries / reasoning essays replacing registers
- A binding FQDN referenced anywhere (topology, RB) but absent from `new_artifacts`
- Two spellings of the same capability (a typo is a SECOND immutable artifact, not a synonym)

A required register with no rows MUST render as a single `| NONE IDENTIFIED |` row. The renderer
rejects a malformed FQDN, an empty required register, an undeclared reference, or a near-duplicate
code mechanically.

---

### Binding-FQDN discipline (the oracle enforces these)

- **Well-formed:** every assigned code is `domain::PREFIX_NAME_V<n>` (PREFIX ∈ WF/IN/RB/CC/CT/EV/
  STRUCTURE; explicit `_V0`).
- **One canonical FQDN per capability — assign it ONCE, reuse the EXACT string everywhere**
  (topology, pipelines, RB, summary). A binding FQDN is immutable: a spelling/term variant of the
  same concept (e.g. `GENESIS` vs `GENEISIS`) silently creates a SECOND, permanently-misnamed
  artifact. Spell domain terms exactly.
- **Referenced ⇒ declared:** every NEW code that appears in `execution_topology` or
  `rb_declarations` MUST appear as a row in `new_artifacts`. CTs and EVs are first-class new
  artifacts — never implicit.
- **Genuinely new:** an assigned `new_artifacts` code MUST NOT already exist in the snapshot
  (the oracle collision-checks via grounding). Existing artifacts go in `existing_inventory`.
- **Reconciled:** the NEW counts in `artifact_summary` MUST equal the rows of `new_artifacts`.

### Capability Composition discipline (the oracle enforces these)

`cc_composition` declares the second half of Design Intent: WHAT each new CC is composed of. Workflow
topology (§5) says how CCs route to one another; composition says what is *inside* each CC. It is
**declarative, not procedural** — you declare the governed capabilities the CC is built from and how
data flows between them; you never write code, JSON, JSONPath, or an implementation.

- **CT/CS only.** Each composition step is a Capability Transform (`CT`, pure compute, zero side
  effects) or a Capability Side Effect (`CS`, the only place external state changes) — never a CC, WF,
  or IN. A CC composes *capabilities*, not other CCs.
- **Codes verbatim.** Every `Capability` cell is a CT/CS binding FQDN copied verbatim from
  `new_artifacts` (NEW) or a grounded `existing_inventory` artifact (REUSE) — same immutability rule
  as every binding FQDN. A composition code absent from both registers is a defect.
- **Data flow is logical, not wired.** `Consumes` / `Produces` name business/data fields (e.g.
  `proposed_block`, `content_hash`), connecting a CC's inputs to its steps and step-to-step. Concrete
  JSONPath wiring is construction (S8), not design.
- **Outcome coverage.** The outcomes the composition can yield MUST cover the CC's routing surface in
  `execution_topology` (§5): if topology routes the CC on `SUCCESS` and `ALREADY_EXISTS`, the
  composition must be able to produce both. The oracle cross-checks composition ⊇ topology surface.
- **CT purity.** A `CT` step may not appear where a side effect is required, and may never be a CS.

### Business-Language Rule

Only the `capability` column of `new_artifacts` is business language (name the need, not the
artifact). Every other column legitimately carries FQDNs / controlled tokens — that is where the
binding codes belong. Existing artifacts are cited by their real FQDN in `fqdn` / source columns.

## Stage Inputs — Questions for the Human

*Answer crisply before drafting. The right column states how the agent uses each answer.*

| # | Question for the Human | How the Agent Uses the Answer (Intent) |
|---|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | For each open design decision carried from Stages 1–4: which concrete resolution (store shape, schema fields, algorithm, reuse-vs-new)? | Becomes `design_resolution`. Every row traces to a Business Model design decision; new decisions invented here are flagged. |
| 2 | Where an existing artifact partially fits: REUSE as-is, EXTEND it, or REPLACE it? | Fixes `existing_inventory` actions. REPLACE/EXTEND of shared artifacts affects other subdomains. |
| 3 | Do you approve the proposed store names, paths, and key fields? | Locks `structure_stores`. Storage topology is a governance concern — paths declared here, never hardcoded later. |
| 4 | Gate 1: do you approve the full dossier as the design basis? | Gate 1 approval authorizes Stage 7. Without it, no mandate may be drafted. |

**Agent execution rules for this stage (binding FQDNs are assigned here):**
- Every new artifact maps 1:1 to a Governance Intent outcome; every FQDN carries `_V<n>`.
- **Workflow nodes are IN, CC, EXIT/EXIT_SUCCESS only.** Sub-workflow invocation = gateway CC bound to `CS_WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_V0` (precedent: `CC_INVOKE_BLOCK_PROPOSAL_V0`). EV_ artifacts are emitted facts, never triggers.
- A store is written only by CCs of its owning subdomain. Writing CCs for peer stores are declared in the dependency-gap section with peer ownership.
- Before declaring a new CT or EV: check the existing inventory (the transform vocabulary and event set usually already contain the atom) — if reused, it belongs in `existing_inventory`, not `new_artifacts`.
- **Compose every new CC.** Each `family = CC` row in `new_artifacts` gets a `cc_composition` (§6): the ordered CT/CS steps it is built from + their data flow. Leaving a CC's composition unstated leaves construction a design decision — exactly the black box this stage exists to close.
- **Module path assignment (reference):** IN→`[repo].registry.[subdomain].intents`, WF→`.workflows`, CC→`.capability_contracts`, CT→`.capability_transforms`, RB→`.runtime_bindings`, STRUCTURE→`.structures`. A missing assignment is a build failure.

## 1. Design Decisions Resolution

*The Design Decisions Register populated throughout Stages 1–4 — resolved here. Each row traces to a Business Model design decision (`source_finding`).*

<!-- register:design_resolution optional -->
| Decision | Business Fact | Resolution | Source Finding |
|----------|---------------|------------|----------------|

---

## 2. Artifact Inventory — Existing Artifacts

*All existing PPS artifacts touched by this CR. Action ∈ REPLACE | REUSE | EXTEND | REVIEW. `fqdn` is the existing artifact, cited by exact FQDN.*

<!-- register:existing_inventory -->
| FQDN | Action (REPLACE, REUSE, EXTEND, REVIEW) | Reason | Source Finding |
|------|------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|

---

## 3. Artifact Family Mapping — New Artifacts

*Each Governance Outcome capability mapped to an artifact family with a binding FQDN assigned.
`capability` is business language; `code` is the binding FQDN; `family` is the execution concern;
`owner_subdomain` is the owning subdomain; `source_finding` traces to the S6 ownership / S4 gap.*

<!-- register:new_artifacts business_language=capability -->
| Capability | Family (AC, IN, WF, RB, CC, CT, EV, STRUCTURE) | Code | Owner Subdomain | Status | Source Finding |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|------|-----------------|--------|----------------|

---

## 4. Runtime Binding (RB) Declarations

*One RB per WF. The RB declares which CS substrates the WF requires and which storage structure resolves store paths. An undeclared CS binding is a runtime failure. `cs_bindings` may list several CS FQDNs (comma-separated).*

<!-- register:rb_declarations -->
| RB Code | Binds WF | CS Bindings | Storage Structure | Source Finding |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|

---

## 5. Execution Topology

*The DAG flattened to one row per node, in execution order, per workflow. `node` is an IN/CC binding FQDN or a terminal (EXIT / EXIT_SUCCESS); `routing` states the outcome→target edges in business status names (SUCCESS, NOT_FOUND, ALREADY_EXISTS, VIOLATION, BACKEND_ERROR).*

<!-- register:execution_topology -->
| Workflow | Node | Node Type (IN, CC, EXIT, EXIT_SUCCESS) | Routing | Source Finding |
|----------|------|----------------------------------------|---------|----------------|

---

## 6. Capability Composition

*The inside of each new CC: the ordered CT/CS steps it is composed of and how data flows between
them. Declarative, not procedural — governed capabilities + data flow, never code or JSONPath. One
row per (CC, step), in execution order. `capability` is a CT/CS binding FQDN (verbatim from
`new_artifacts` or `existing_inventory`); `consumes`/`produces` name logical data fields. The
outcomes the composition can yield must cover the CC's routing surface in `execution_topology` (§5).
`Interface` (CT steps) is the **explicit invocation binding** — how this step's CC-local fields bind
to the invoked capability's declared FORMAL parameters, so a reusable CT keeps its own vocabulary and
the CC keeps its business vocabulary. Syntax: `in: <ct_formal>=<cc_local>, …; out: <ct_output>=<cc_local>, …`
(e.g. `in: left=predecessor_hash, right=current_head; out: is_equal=is_match`). CS steps leave it blank.*

<!-- register:cc_composition optional -->
| CC Code | Step | Capability | Kind (CT, CS) | Operation | Consumes | Produces | Interface |
|---------|------|------------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|

---

## 7. STRUCTURE Stores

*New entity stores. `storage_type` selects the CS substrate; `proposed_path` is the declared store path (governance concern — never hardcoded later); `used_by` names the writing CC (its owning subdomain only).*

<!-- register:structure_stores optional -->
| Store Name | Storage Type (CS_APPENDONLY_JSONL_V0, CS_MUTABLE_JSON_V0) | Proposed Path | Used By | Source Finding |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|----------------|

---

## 8. Artifact Summary

*Artifact count by action type, for Stage 7 input. The oracle reconciles: the NEW counts here MUST equal the rows of `new_artifacts`. `artifacts` lists the codes for that action.*

<!-- register:artifact_summary -->
| Action (REPLACE, EXTEND, NEW) | Subdomain | Count | Artifacts |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|

---

## Gate 1 — Design Approval

**Gate 1 closes here.** The full dossier (Stages 0–6b) is presented for review as a body. Any
prior-stage artifact amended during the Stage 6–6b session is included. This is a unified review of
the complete design, not a per-stage approval. Gate 1 approval authorizes Stage 7 — Authoring
Mandate. Gate 2 (after Stage 7) locks the full dossier before artifact authoring begins.

## gov_projection — Governed Handoff to Stage 7

*The bounded inputs and emit keys mirror the engine's gov_projection schema exactly
(`contracts/gov_projection.py`). 6b is the binding stage — it consumes the full design context
(S2 attribute/step data, S4 gaps/decisions, S5 intent + provisional codes, S6 placement) and emits
the five registers S7 builds from, plus `cc_composition` which the S8 Build Sheet assembles. Emit
keys match the register ids above exactly.*
